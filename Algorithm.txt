Task 1:
1: Ask the user to enter a number and a nth number
2:Set divisor to(True )if nth number mod n number = 0
3:If divisor =True ,set answer(nth number mod 2)
4:if answer is equal to 0 ,set(nth number = even)
5:if answer is not equal to 0,set(nth number =odd) 


Task  : 3
1: Ask the user to enter two numbers
2: Ask the user to enter operator
3: Set answer to (Number1 + Number 2)if operator = “+”
4: Set answer to (Number1 - Number 2)if operator = “-”
5: Set answer to (Number1 * Number 2)if operator = “*”
6: Set answer to (Number1 / Number 2)if operator = “/”
7:Display answer for the user
